Installation guide
==================

This document gives information about the steps, which have to be taken to install 
(or integrate) the partner solution into Qtopia.


Installation How-to
===================

To build and install the Qt virtual keyboard library, change into the library's
base directory and do the following steps:

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build/
    $ qmake ../virtualkeyboard.pro
    $ make

If you want to install the Qt virtual keyboad library or use the Designer plugin
(you might need super-user rights):

    $ make install


Building for Qtopia involves different steps, change into the librarie's base
directory and do the following steps:

    $ $QPEDIR/bin/qtopiamake virtualkeyboard.pro
    $ make
    $ make install


Examples
========

To build the examples after you have installed the library, change into the 
librarie's base directory and do the following steps:

    $ mkdir build-examples
    $ cd build-examples
    $ qmake ../examples/examples.pro
    $ make
    $ make install

You should then be able to start the examples:

    $ ./keypad/keypad
    $ ./keyboard/keyboard


API documentation
=================

To generate the API documenation you need to have Doxygen installed. Change into the 
library's base directory and utilize:

    $ doxygen

You should then be able to find the generated API documentation in the 'doc' folder
in the base directory as HTML or LaTex.
